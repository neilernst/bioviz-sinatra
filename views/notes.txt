/ if you need it once, you can simply load it into a javascript var, using the technique described on http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_parser.asp and then addressing that variable in your processing.js script. 	however, if you need to load it in response to something during the sketch's lifetime, you may need to get a little more creative (at least until 0.9.4 when external hooking is hopefully back in, and you can load and xml element the way w3cschools outlines, then directly handing it off to the sketch)

	if (window.XMLHttpRequest)
	{

	xhttp.send();

	xmlDoc=xhttp.responseXML;
	txt = xmlDoc.getElementsByTagName("known_gene_symbol")[0]//.nodeValue;
	document.write(txt);
